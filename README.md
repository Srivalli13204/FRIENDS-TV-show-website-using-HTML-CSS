# F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV SHOW Website

This website is a fan-made website dedicated to the iconic TV show FRIENDS, showing its characters, episodes, reviews and more. 

Using HTML and CSS, I created a website for the American Sitcom F.R.I.E.N.D.S that provides information about the show, including crew member details, streaming options, user ratings and reviews, and a complete episode guide.
